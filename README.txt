# Getting Started - User Guide

Thank you for taking the time to set-up the functional prototype: Adulting 101 
To ensure all features and assets load correctly in your browser, 
this prototype runs via a small local server.

---

## QUICK START

1. Open the "Usability-Prototype" folder.
2. Run the file corresponding to your operating system:
   - WINDOWS: Double-click "start-windows.bat"
   - MAC: Double-click "start-mac.command"
3. Your default browser should open automatically at http://localhost:8080.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If the browser does not open or you see an error message:

1. PYTHON INSTALLATION:
   These scripts require "Python". Most systems have this pre-installed. 
   If it is missing, you can download it for free at https://www.python.org/.

2. MANUAL ACCESS:
   If the browser window doesn't open automatically after starting the script, 
   simply type the following address into your browser's address bar:
   http://localhost:8080

3. PERMISSION ISSUES (MAC ONLY):
   If "start-mac.command" fails to run due to permissions, you need to 
   grant execution rights:
   - Open the "Terminal" app.
   - Type "chmod +x " (include a space at the end).
   - Drag the "start-mac.command" file into the Terminal window.
   - Press Enter.

## SHUTTING DOWN
To stop the server, simply close the command prompt or terminal window 
that opened when you started the prototype.
